# Promoter region recognition

## Description
This project search for known motifs in the upstream promoter regions of a set of coexpressed genes. The file zea_mays_genes.txt
contains a list of maize (Zea mays) gene identifiers for a group of co-regulated maize genes. The file promoters contains a list of experimentally identified transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) that are active in maize. The script extracts the upstream non-coding sequence for each gene in zea_mays_genes.txt.
